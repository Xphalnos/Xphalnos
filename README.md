# About me :

Hi! I'm **Xphalnos** and I'm a French guy passionate about emulation.

Currently I dedicate part of my free time to [**shadPS4**](https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4), which I think will become the best emulator given how the development is progressing.

I am also the creator of the [**shadPS4 logo**](https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4/blob/main/.github/shadps4.png).

I am continuously learning **C++** to try to be better.
